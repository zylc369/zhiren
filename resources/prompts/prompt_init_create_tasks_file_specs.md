Break the **IDEA CONTENT** into atomic tasks WITH VERIFIABLE OUTCOMES:
- First, set up the environment according to the tech stack, e.g., install dependencies, initialize required directories (such as node_modules, vendor, or .env).
- **For existing projects**: Tasks should modify or extend existing code.
- Then, implement the features from the **IDEA CONTENT** in logical sequence.
- Each task completable in one iteration
- **Format: `- [ ] Action → Outcome`**
  - Action: What to implement
  - Outcome: How to verify it worked (must be machine-checkable)
- Examples:
  - `- [ ] Add login button to navbar → Button with href="/login" exists in header`
  - `- [ ] Create /api/users endpoint → GET /api/users returns 200 with JSON array`
  - `- [ ] Add email validation → Invalid email shows error message`
- Number of tasks should match project scope (don't pad)
