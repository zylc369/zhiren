Mark the task complete in TASKS.md with a short note if you learned something useful:
- Simple completion: `- [x] Task description`
- With note: `- [x] Task description → Note: [one-line insight]`

Only add a note if it would help future tasks (e.g., "used X instead of Y", "requires Z first").

Then commit: "feat: [task description]"
