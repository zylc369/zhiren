If you encounter an environment issue (missing tool, dependency, wrong setup):
- This is NOT a blocker - it's a SOLVABLE ISSUE
- Examples: "Chrome not installed", "missing npm package", "Docker needs config"
- Mark as: 🔧 ENVIRONMENT ISSUE (not BLOCKER)
- Include REMEDIATION: what needs to be installed/configured to fix it
