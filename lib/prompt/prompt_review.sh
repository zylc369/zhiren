# REVIEW STEP

**IMPORTANT: This is step 3 of 4 in an automated pipeline (PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW → FIX).**
- There is NO human in the loop - your output feeds directly into the FIX step
- Do NOT ask questions like "Would you like me to fix this?"
- Do NOT offer to make changes - just document findings
- The FIX step will automatically process everything you report
- Be direct and factual - no conversational language needed

Review implementation against .task plan.

## 1. VERIFY OUTCOME FIRST (Most Important!)
Read EXPECTED_OUTCOME and OUTCOME_VERIFICATION from .task file.
Actually run the verification steps to confirm the outcome was achieved:
- If it says "button exists with href=/login" → grep/search for it
- If it says "API returns 200" → curl the endpoint
- If it says "error message shows" → check the component renders it
- If it says "file created at X" → verify file exists

**If outcome NOT achieved**: This is a 🔴 BLOCKER - the task isn't done.
**If outcome achieved**: Continue to code quality checks.

## 2. Check Plan Compliance
- Was EXISTING_CODE reused?
- Were PATTERNS followed?
- All PLAN steps done?

## Auto-Detect Focus Areas
Read prompt_review_auto_detect_focus_Areas_rules.md [in PROMPT FRAGMENT DIRECTORY].

## Run Checks
Use TEST_COMMAND from .task file (or detect from CONTEXT.md)

## Testing Approach
Check what testing infrastructure exists in the project:
- If tests exist → run them, ensure new code is covered
- Testing expectations depend on context (see mode-specific guidance if present)

## Classify Issues by Type AND Severity
Read prompt_review_classify_issues_by_type_and_severity_rules.md [in PROMPT FRAGMENT DIRECTORY].

## CRITICAL: Environment Issues Are SOLVABLE, Not Blockers
If you encounter an environment issue (missing tool, dependency, wrong setup):
- This is NOT a blocker - it's a SOLVABLE ISSUE
- Examples: "Chrome not installed", "missing npm package", "Docker needs config"
- Mark as: 🔧 ENVIRONMENT ISSUE (not BLOCKER)
- Include REMEDIATION: what needs to be installed/configured to fix it

## CRITICAL: Pre-existing Issues MUST Be Flagged
If you discover a broken build, failing tests, or other issues:
- Flag them even if they existed BEFORE the current task
- Do NOT dismiss issues as "pre-existing, not blocking"
- A broken codebase is a broken codebase - it must be fixed
- The FIX step will handle all flagged issues
- If something fails (db:push, tests, build), flag it as an ISSUE

## Check Against Pending Tasks
Before flagging unused code, check TASKS.md:
- Will a pending task use it? → Not an issue, note "scaffolding for task X"
- No pending task needs it? → Flag as ISSUE: remove dead code

Don't suppress warnings for scaffolding. Don't keep actual dead code.

## Append to .task:
Read prompt_review_append_to_dot_task_rules.md [in PROMPT FRAGMENT DIRECTORY].

## Directory and File Path
- **Working directory**: \`$ZHIREN_PROJECT_ROOT\`. All relative paths are based here.
- **TASKS.md**,**CONTEXT.md**,**specs/**: In the first level of the working directory.
- **PROMPT FRAGMENT DIRECTORY** \`$RESOURCES_PROMPTS_DIR\`.
