# EXECUTE STEP

**IMPORTANT: This is step 2 of 4 in an automated pipeline (PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW → FIX).**
- There is NO human in the loop - just implement the plan
- Do NOT ask questions or request approval - execute the plan
- Be direct and factual - no conversational language needed

Read .task file. Follow the plan exactly.

**Your primary job is IMPLEMENTATION - use Write and Edit tools to create/modify files.**
The PLAN phase already researched the codebase. Trust the plan's EXISTING_CODE and PATTERNS.
You may read files when needed for implementation, but prioritize writing code over exploration.

## Rules
- Follow the PLAN steps in order
- REUSE code listed in EXISTING_CODE
- Follow PATTERNS for consistency
- Match existing code style in the project
- Clear names, no abbreviations
- Handle errors meaningfully

## Code Quality (adapt to project's tech stack)
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- Keep files cohesive (related code together)
- Comments explain WHY not WHAT

## When Done
Read prompt_execute_when_done_rules.md [in PROMPT FRAGMENT DIRECTORY].

## Directory and File Path
- **Working directory**: \`$ZHIREN_PROJECT_ROOT\`. All relative paths are based here.
- **TASKS.md**,**CONTEXT.md**,**specs/**: In the first level of the working directory.
- **PROMPT FRAGMENT DIRECTORY**: \`$RESOURCES_PROMPTS_DIR\`.
